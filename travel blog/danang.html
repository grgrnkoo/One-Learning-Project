            <h5>The Golden Bridge</h5>
            <p>The Golden Bridge (Hand God Bridge) is the newest attraction in Ba Na Hills, Danang.  Danang is a coastal city in Central Vietnam and is known for its long white beaches and unique and beautiful designed buildings and bridges, like the yellow fire and water spitting Dragon Bridge at the city center. Thus, there is no surprise that the viral Golden Bridge is also found in Danang. Golden Bridge is just 23 kilometers away from Danang City Center.

                Golden Bridge is a part of the most sought after resort and recreational complex, the Sunworld Ba Na Hills.

            <h5>Marble Mountains</h5>
            <p>There are five peaks named after the five basic elements in Eastern philosophy – metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They look like a god’s hand when seen from above, suggesting that this is a holy land.
                <br><br>
                Legend says that an old fisherman, who lived on the Danang coast, suddenly saw a dragon emerging from the water to lay an egg. After the dragon had disappeared back into the water, a golden turtle, who claimed to be a god named Kim Quy, came and dug a hole in which to bury the egg.
                <br><br>
                The turtle gave the fisherman one toenail and instructed him to protect the dragon egg from hawks and other predators. The dragon egg hatched a beautiful girl and the eggshell broke into five pieces, which turned into the five Marble Mountains.
                <br><br>
                The Marble Mountains today are a nature reserve sheltering historical relics with a spiritual dimension. The sounds of wind and wooden bells, the fragrance of incense, and the transitory mountain shadows make visitors feel a deep peace in their souls.</p>
